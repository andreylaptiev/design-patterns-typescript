# Design patterns

**Design patterns** are sets of best practices for different purposes which help to write scalable and maintainable OOP code.

### Categories of design patterns:
- **Architectural** - define best practices for high-level app structure. Not strictly related to OOP.
- **Creational** - contain efficient ways of creating new objects.
- **Stuctural** - provide ways to structure classes and set relations between them.
- **Behavioral** - determine approaches to build effective interaction between objects of different classes.

This repository contains my implementations of design patterns from categories listed above.
